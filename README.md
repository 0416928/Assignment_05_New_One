## Reflection

### 1. Identify any challenges or issues you encountered while writing your functions

- While writing my functions, I faced indentation issues and it was really overwhelming to see where the indentation is not properly settled.

### 2. Discuss the benefits and challenges of developing and using unit tests

- I believe now that by using unit test we can test every step of our code and this makes our project successful. Testing every corner helps us to ensure that everything is working as expected. Firstly, it was bit confusing for me to understand but after writing few unittests I now feel that this is the best and easy way to test our program.
